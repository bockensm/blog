	<h1>About Mark</h1>

	<p>
		I've been a professional developer since graduating college with a bachelor's
		degree in Computer Science in 2007. My jobs have been primarily PHP (1 year),
		Python (3 years), and ColdFusion (since 2011). Over the last few years I've become
		more interested in client-side development due in large part to the rapidly changing
		and evolving JavaScript ecosystem. I am quite comfortable with Vue, ES6, and TypeScript.
